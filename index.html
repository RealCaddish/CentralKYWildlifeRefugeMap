  <h2> Welcome to my page about the Central Kentucky Wildlife Refuge in Boyle County, Kentucky! </h2>
    <div.a>
    <p>Recently, I had the opportunity to develop a brochure trail map of this special place and decided that I should say a few words and give it the ample recognition it deserves. The Refuge serves as a home to a myriad of various local species and natural habitats within its 500-acre premises. Not only are local wildlife invited to enjoy the preservation, local homo <i>sapiens</i> are also welcome to come learn and enjoy the diversity that the park offers throughout the year.</p>

  <h2>Kinder Words From Mother Nature's Embrace<h2>
    <p> Many events take place at the Refuge throughout the year including various bird-sighting hikes, wildlflower tours, voluntary trail cleaning, and starry celestial night watches. I'd like to note that the latter of these events is often worthy of an impressive display - especially considering how the Refuge is one of those few places left where light pollution hasn't encroached too harshly</p>
    <p>I have many memories as a youthful kid eternally curious at this wonderful park! My first experience with the CKWR was when I was a sprite 13-year old who happened to catch one of these beauties during summer camp:

  </p>
    <p>Ah yes, you're currently observing the northern spring salamander (G.p. <i>porphyriticus</i>) - not to be confused with it's very similar cousin, the Kentucky (G.p. <i>duryi</i>), often found in northeastern Kentucky and southern Ohio. 
    <br>And just in case your curiosity is piqued, <i>for the record</i> I caught this majestic creature humanely with a cloth net and a catch-and-release fervor.

  <h3> The Central Kentucky Wildlife Refuge Trail Map </h3>

<p> I should note that this map doesn't reflect the brochure copy <i> as such </i> because the brochure was a collaborative effort with a friend of mine who is much more design savvy than I am. Fortunately, she taught me a lot of tips and tricks that helped me along the way so I'm seriously grateful for all of her help designing this one. Hopefully when the brochure is available, I'll hyperlink that somewhere below. </p>

<h4>Map Postscript</h4>
<p> The challenges associated with this mapping project were testament to the balancing act between data-precision and aesthetic design. If any lessons  were learned from this project, I think it's safe to say that this one stands out the most. As geographers, we have to recognize those imbalances and think of means to provide clear justification for why one variable must be sacrificed for another. As we know in our field, projections are  limited by their functional aims, depending on various uses such as navigation or areal measurements. Creating this map required a balancing act for its two very different yet very important roles. First, a functional role is established - primarily for navigation of the terrain at the CKWR, and second, an aesthetic role where the map can most easily speak to the general public.</p>
